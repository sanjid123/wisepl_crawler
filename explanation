Let's go through the code step by step to understand what each part does:


# Install the necessary packages
!pip install bing-image-downloader

This line uses the `!` symbol to execute a shell command in the Jupyter/Colab environment. 
It installs the Python package `bing-image-downloader` using the pip package manager. 
If the package is not already installed, this command will download and install it.


# Import the required modules
from bing_image_downloader import downloader
from google.colab import files
import shutil

These lines import the required modules for the script. 
`bing_image_downloader` is the library used to download images from Bing, 
`files` from `google.colab` is used for downloading files, and 
`shutil` is used for file operations like zipping.


# Define search keywords
search_keywords = [
    "Your queries 1",
    "Your queries 2",
    "Your queries 3",
    "Your queries 4"
]

Here, we define a list called `search_keywords`, which contains the search queries we want to use to find images. 
Replace `"Your queries 1"`, `"Your queries 2"`, etc., with the actual search terms for our requirement.


# Set the download limit for each keyword
download_limit = 25

This line sets the maximum number of images to be downloaded for each search keyword. 
The `download_limit` variable is set to `25`, meaning that the script will download up to 25 images for each search query.


# Create a directory to save the images
output_dir = "crawled_images"
!mkdir -p $output_dir

This code creates a directory called `crawled_images` to save the downloaded images. 
The `!mkdir -p $output_dir` shell command is used to create the directory, and the `$output_dir` variable holds the name of the directory.


# Download images for each keyword
for keyword in search_keywords:
    downloader.download(keyword, limit=download_limit, output_dir=output_dir)

This is the main loop of the script. 
It iterates through each search keyword in the `search_keywords` list and downloads images from Bing for each keyword. 
The `downloader.download()` function is called with the specified `keyword`, `download_limit`, and `output_dir`, 
which downloads the images and saves them in the `crawled_images` directory.


print("Download completed.")

After downloading all the images, this line prints "Download completed." to indicate that the image download process has finished.


# Zip the crawled_images directory
shutil.make_archive("/content/crawled_images", 'zip', "/content/crawled_images")

Here, the `shutil.make_archive()` function is used to create a zip archive of the `crawled_images` directory. 
The first argument `"/content/crawled_images"` specifies the base name of the archive file (without the extension), 
and the second argument `'zip'` indicates that the archive will be in ZIP format. 
The third argument `"/content/crawled_images"` is the directory to be archived.


# Download the zip file to your local computer
files.download("/content/crawled_images.zip")

Finally, this line downloads the created ZIP archive file named `crawled_images.zip` to your local computer using `files.download()` from `google.colab`.

In summary, this code downloads images from Bing based on the specified search queries, saves them in a directory called `crawled_images`, zips the directory, and then provides a download link for the ZIP archive. The user can then download the ZIP file to their local computer, containing the downloaded images.
